```

```{r, results='asis'}

#To get stargazer to work with a pdf output, I had to put results = 'asis' in the code chunk. 

#Using the normal output method I used in the past gave me a gross looking table, so I changed it to header = FALSE and type = 'latex' to make it compatable with the pdf output, I suppose. 

stargazer(model_x, header=FALSE, type='latex')

```


```{r}

#Google Scholar has a citation feature where you can export the citation as a BibTeX 
#...which didn't actually save it as a .bib file, but rather as .txt, so that seems promising but didn't work for me this time. 

#So I looked online and found a paper by Jenny Bryant that saved as a .bib 



```


Here is an example of how to footnote.^[This is the text of footnote 1] 
And another one.^[This is the text of footnote 2]

Here is some text that I want to cite in the bibliography [see @bib.bib]

# References

```{r generateBibliography, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

cleanbib()
options("citation_format" = "pandoc")
read.bibtex(file = "bib.bib")

#ok so this isn't a great working example but the idea is here.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
